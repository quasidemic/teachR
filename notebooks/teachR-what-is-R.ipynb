    "R is a free software environment with its own programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is especailly suited for statistical analysis and graphical outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "R's popularity as a data science tool as well as it being open source has made its applications vast.\n",
    "\n",
    "R can work with a large variety of data formats and is (with a few add-ons) compatible with data from other software solutions (Excel, SPSS, SAS, Stata)."

    "\n",
    "Compared to analysis software like Stata and SPSS, the R language is much closer to a programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "R itself has a very limited GUI (graphical user interface). RStudio provides more options but the GUI does not assist in the data analysis tasks (i.e. there is no point-and-click options for using R as such).\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of R's versatility comes from the fact that R treats everything as different objects (more on this later). Compared to most other analysis software, this means that you are often working with several data sets simultaneously."

    "\n",
    "Relative paths are specified relative to the current working directory. By default, R will set the working directory to the user documents folder. One can check the current working directory with the command `getwd()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The working directory can be changed with the command `setwd()` (or in RStudio via `Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory...`). \n",
    "\n",
    "When using relative paths from the working directory, one can use `.` to specify current directory (assumed either way) and `..` to go up one level. If data fx is in the working directory, one only has to specify the filename of the dataset (`data.csv`). If it is located inside a data folder in the working directory, it is specified as `./data/data.csv`."
